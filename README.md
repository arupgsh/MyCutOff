# MyCutOff
### MyCutOff is a PHP  and Mysql based web scraping script for Indian ecommerce websites.

The script can be used to parse data from Indian ecommerce websites like Amazon, eBay, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Infibeam and Jabong.
By default the script parses product title and price and there is a cron job which updates the price and availability status of
all listed products in data base.

## Installation
